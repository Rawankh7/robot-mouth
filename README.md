Smiley Mouth Display on 8x8 LED Matrix with Arduino


This project displays a smiley mouth pattern on an 8x8 LED matrix using an Arduino and the LedControl library. The code sends the smiley pattern to the matrix row-by-row, ensuring proper orientation. The display updates every second, alternating between showing the smiley mouth and a cleared screen.
